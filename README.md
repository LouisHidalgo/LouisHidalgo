### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

Hello! My Name is Louis A Hidalgo II. 
I am currently aspiring programming student with Tech Elevator. 
I am currently working on learning the Tech Elevator Program which includes three different programming languages. 
I look forward to working with other programming students to complete projects and assignments. 
When I am not working or coding, I am hanging with friends, gaming, or volunteering at an animal shelter. 
Feel free to ask me anything you might want to know about me. The best way to reach me is via email or my student profile.
