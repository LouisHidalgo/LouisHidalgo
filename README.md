Hello! My Name is Louis A Hidalgo II. 
I am currently an aspiring computer programmer. 
I have completed the Tech Elevator Program which includes three different programming languages. 
I look forward to continue to learn and code by completing new bootcamps, on-line content, projects and assignments. 
When I am not working or coding, I am hanging with friends, gaming, or volunteering at an animal shelter. 
Feel free to ask me anything you might want to know about me. The best way to reach me is via email or my LinkedIn Profile.
